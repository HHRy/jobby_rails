h1. Jobby Rails

Jobby Rails is a lightweight interface to Jobby, a gem which allows many
concurrent 'jobs' to be run asynchronously from one another.

Jobby Rails provides everything you need to pass on long running tasks, to
Jobby to be executed. What makes this solution unique to all the other is that
(up to a specified maximum of child processes), Jobby executes your tasks in 
_parallel_.

Jobs and Freelancers (See the Documentation) are given your Rails environment
and can access all of your Models and so on. Jobby (and Jobby Rails) is COW
Friendly if your Ruby Interpreter supports it.

interpreters which support the @fork()@ system call. 

Unsupported Platforms:
